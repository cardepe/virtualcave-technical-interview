 ## Technologies
 This project was build with the latest version of [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/blog/2023/08/24/spring-boot-3-1-3-available-now) and [Java 17](https://jdk.java.net/17/), adding these libraries:

 * [r2dbc](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc) as reactive db framework.

 * [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) as autogenerated entity and dto fields.
 * [mapstruct](https://mapstruct.org/) as mapping from class to class.
 * [h2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) and [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) to connect and execute postgre queries.
 * [junit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to build tests.
 * [wiremock](https://wiremock.org/) to test rest calls.

## Hexagonal architecture

### Folder structure

```sh

  ├───bootloader
  ├───currency

```

This structure has been created where each functionality is isolated in its own module, and within each one it follows a hexagonal architecture, allowing in this way, in case of having to eliminate or inherit a type, only the module has to be reviewed in question.
